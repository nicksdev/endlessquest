OUTSTANDING TASKS:

Refactor Rooms so common commands (help etc) are not types for each room.

Combat (basics):

- Define character (Str + HP's)
- Define Inventory
- Add weapon (with damage value)
- Add monstor (Str + HP's)
- Add monstor weapon (claws?) and damage





ROOM LOAD ISSUE

everytime press enter, its loads the room function
this means that if there is a command mistyped it runs the function again.
